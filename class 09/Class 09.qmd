##Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
PDB_summary<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
```

a function to drop the comma :(
```{r}
rm.comma<-function(x){
  as.numeric(gsub(",","",x))
}
PDB_summary1<-apply(PDB_summary, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(PDB_summary1)<-rownames(PDB_summary)
PDB_summary1
```

```{r}
PDB_summary1_total <-apply(PDB_summary1, 2, sum)
round(PDB_summary1_total/PDB_summary1_total["Total"]*100, 2)


```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

Skipped 

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Skipped

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Because the cystrallography only have resolution of 2A, which is bigger than the H atom so therefore H is not showing in here. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

See above images, Water 308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

See above images.

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?
